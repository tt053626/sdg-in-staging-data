The data basis for the air pollution of the planning areas (PLR) are the annual mean values 2009 of the concentration of particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Both values were collected on the basis of 500 by 500 meter grid cells on the one hand and as linear information on main road sections on the other hand. From these data, area-weighted annual mean values for PM2.5 and NO2 were determined for each PLR. Subsequently, the determined values were divided into three categories (low, medium, high). The bottom 20 percent are considered low impact, the top 20 percent high impact, and all others medium impact.\nThe result: Air pollution in Berlin increases from the periphery to the center. For PM2.5, the values in the least polluted PLR were 14.8 \u03bcg/m\u00b3 and in the most polluted PLR 18.4 \u03bcg/m\u00b3, which means that the benchmark value of 10 \u03bcg/m\u00b3 recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) was exceeded in all PLRs in Berlin. For NO2, the values ranged from 11.3 to 27.3 \u03bcg/m\u00b3, which means that the WHO guideline value of 40 \u03bcg/m\u00b3 was not exceeded.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-07: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/beyersar/DataTK/commit/b84d6acb272adb24bed7007d0460b73a047bb0d0","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-07-07: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/beyersar/DataTK/commit/d05ccce0afc73d44335d622654aea7f60c7c947a","indicator":"3.3.1","target_id":"3.3","sdg_goal":"3","indicator_sort_order":"03-03-01"},"15-4-1":{"data_non_statistical":false,"goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-15-04-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (pdf 456kB)","graph_title":"Coverage by protected areas of important sites for mountain biodiversity","graph_type":"line","indicator_number":"15.4.1","indicator_name":"Coverage by protected areas of important sites for mountain biodiversity","indicator_sort_order":"15-04-01","published":true,"reporting_status":"notstarted","sdg_goal":"15","target_name":"SDG indicator -

get an overall view of the environmental situation in Berlin, the state of Berlin has implemented an environmental justice monitoring. \nThe environmental justice monitoring evaluates existing data of different core indicators (e.g. noise pollution and air pollution) and aggregates these data on a neighborhood level, respectively on a total of 447 so called planning areas (PLR), whereas Treptow-K\u00f6penick is divided into 34 planning areas.\nThe data basis for the noise pollution of the planning areas (PLRs) was the Strategic Noise Map 2012 with the LDEN levels (noise index day-evening-night) for road, rail and air traffic noise. Since the areas have different densities, the traffic noise exposure per capita was determined and monetized at external noise costs per person.\nThe noise costs financially represent the loss of benefit that residents experience. The cost rates for this were provided by the Methodology Convention 2.0 of the Federal Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt). According to these noise costs per capita, the 447 PLRs were sorted in ascending order and divided into three categories: The bottom 20 percent are considered low impact, the top 20 percent high impact, and all others medium impact.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-07: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/beyersar/DataTK/commit/e3661ec21ff00f3320dc9f7cb4a573ca27af4715","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-07-07: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/beyersar/DataTK/commit/1351632fe12c0a9137a3674abeee63d846d6b2b1","indicator":"3.2.1","target_id":"3.2","sdg_goal":"3","indicator_sort_order":"03-02-01"},"8-4-2":{"data_non_statistical":false,"goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-08-04-02.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 58.7 KB)","graph_title":"Domestic material consumption, domestic material consumption per capita, and domestic material consumption per GDP","graph_type":"line","indicator_number":"8.4.2","indicator_name":"Domestic material consumption, domestic material consumption per capita, and domestic material consumption per GDP","indicator_sort_order":"08-04-02","published":true,"reporting_status":"notstarted","sdg_goal":"8","target_name":"Measure -
