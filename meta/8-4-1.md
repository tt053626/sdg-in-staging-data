The indicator shows the gross hourly earnings of women and men and the unadjusted gender pay gap in Berlin. Exact data for Treptow-Köpenick is unfortunately not available. The unadjusted gender pay gap is measured as the difference in average gross hourly earnings (excluding special payments) of women relative to average gross hourly earnings of men, without taking causal factors into account. All employees in Berlin were taken into account in the earnings structure survey.
