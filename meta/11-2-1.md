The indicator shows the number of pick-up points in the neighborhoods of Treptow-Köpenick for products from community-supported agriculture (CSA). <br>

In community-supported agriculture, food is no longer sold on the open market, but directly through harvest shares. 
Specifically, it is an association of farms with a group of private households. 
The farms have more security and the consumers are part of a transparent economic cycle which is not only financed but also co-organized by them. <br>
